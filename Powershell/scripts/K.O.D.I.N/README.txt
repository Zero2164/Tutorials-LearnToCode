Welcome to K.O.D.I.N the (Kyle's Official Direct Interface Navigator).

The K.O.D.I.N project was created to collate all of my scripts and create a user interface directly from the powershell terminal.
Mainly to help with my daily tasks, this initially allows me to centralise all of the scripts to avoid looking dumb when I cannot find that 'one script I wrote ages ago..'.
The K.O.D.I.N project also assists with work related tasks, having an ever-growing library of powershell sripts that enter the Exchange Online shell.
